Spring Boot Notification Service
This is a Spring Boot application that provides a Notification Service. The project uses Springfox with OpenAPI 3.0 for API documentation, MailHog for email testing, and RabbitMQ for message queuing.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Java 8 or later
Maven 3.x
Docker
Clone the Repository
To get the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

Copy
git clone [https://github.com/lamthaithanhlong/spring-boot-notification.git](https://github.com/lamthaithanhlong/notification-service)
Set up MailHog and RabbitMQ
Run MailHog and RabbitMQ using Docker:

Copy
docker run -d -p 8025:8025 -p 1025:1025 --name mailhog mailhog/mailhog
docker run -d -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 --name rabbitmq rabbitmq:3-management
This will start MailHog on ports 8025 (web interface) and 1025 (SMTP), and RabbitMQ on ports 5672 (AMQP) and 15672 (management interface).

Build and Run the Application
